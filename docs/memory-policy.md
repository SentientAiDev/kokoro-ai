# Memory Policy

## Memory types
A) Working Memory: session-only, auto-discarded.
B) Episodic Memory: summaries of journal entries.
C) Preference Memory: explicit user-consented facts.

## Consent rules
- Preference memory requires explicit consent: “Soll ich mir das merken?”
- Episodic memory is stored as "journal archive" with user understanding at signup.

## Sensitive data
Never store: passwords, full payment card, government IDs, full addresses, health diagnoses.
If detected, redact and store only a neutral placeholder: “[redacted sensitive detail]”.

## Transparency UI
Every recalled memory must show:
- source date
- memory type
- reason for recall
- delete button
